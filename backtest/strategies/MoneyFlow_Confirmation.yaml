  - name: "MoneyFlow_Confirmation"
    weight: 1.0
    combine: "any"
    # Use "any" because each rule independently signals potential buying/selling pressure.
    # This strategy fires when *any* strong money flow condition is detected.

    rules:
      # ---- BUY: Oversold Money Flow ----
      - indicator: "mfi_14"
        operator: "<"
        value: 30
        action: "buy"
        strength: 1.0
        # BUY when MFI14 < 20 (oversold).
        # MFI is price + volume combined signal.
        # Oversold readings suggest seller exhaustion and possible rebound.

      # ---- SELL: Overbought Money Flow ----
      - indicator: "mfi_14"
        operator: ">"
        value: 90
        action: "sell"
        strength: 1.0
        # SELL when MFI14 > 80 (overbought).
        # Indicates excessive buying pressure and potential mean reversion pullback.

      # ---- BUY: Volume Confirmation ----
      - indicator: "Volume"
        operator: ">"
        value_indicator: "vol_sma_20"
        action: "buy"
        strength: 0.4
        # BUY when today's volume > 20-day volume SMA.
        # This is a weaker confirmation signal (strength 0.4).
        # It indicates accumulation or increased activity supporting a potential rebound.
